After the great experiences with gpEasy, we are now migrating our webpages to GitHub Pages. This migration was triggered by our thought to put our open source hardware project pages, documentation and blogs as close as possible to the project repositories. Eventhough we cannot use gpEasy anymore, we keep all contents as it were.
