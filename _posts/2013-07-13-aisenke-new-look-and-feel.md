Aisenke's website has a new look and feel and... a blog! We have been thinking about adding a blog and multilingual translation on our website. It was not easy to choose among a lot of content management system (CMS). But finally, we found one that fits our need, gpEasy. It is a free and easy CMS for everyone, featuring fast and easy installation on your server. You don't need to install any database server, because it is a flatfile CMS. Please refer to their website for further information. As for multilingual, we added Google translator which will translate English content into any language available on the list. We know that Google translator is not able to translate all content perfectly. However, this service is the only one we found available for doing instant translation.
