			<h3 class="panel-title">Teaching STEM with Modular Robotics ( for Teachers )</h3>
		  </div>
		  <div class="panel-body">
			<p><strong>STORM Lab Modular Architecture for Capsule Robot (SMAC)</strong> is a modular toolkit consisting of a collection of sensor and actuator modules such as sound, temperature, pressure, acceleration, motor driver, etc. Creating science projects with SMAC is as easy as combining snap-on hardware modules. Each module is reusable because it has magnetic contacts instead of conventional wiring and soldering, making it perfect for quick prototyping.
</p>
			<p><strong>Science Project in Minutes!</strong> Either you want to build a mini weather station, a line following robot, or an energy usage monitoring platform for classroom teaching or after school projects; SMAC is a perfect tool to engage students more with its hands-on experience. SMAC also includes a range of wireless modules, connecting it over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth are seamless with no prior knowledge of programming.</p>

			<p><strong>Open Knowledge</strong>, we believe that SMAC technology can be used to teach STEM in various way. The SMAC “blue print” is available online as an open source technology; encouraging teachers, students, makers and hobbyists to learn and develop in a Do-It-Together (DIT) style. Visit <a href="/">SMAC Project</a> page to learn more about it.</p>
			<p><strong>Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)</strong></p>
			<p>An open fellowship for teachers, funded by The National Science Foundation (NSF), for the course of 8-10 weeks of summer lab research at <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/stormlab">STORM Lab</a> - <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University</a>, is available with the following tasks for teachers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Learn how the existing capsule robots are built in the laboratory out of miniature modules.</li>
				<li>Experimenting and improving our small modular platform to better fit within the Next Generation Science Standard (NGSS).</li>
				<li>Writing lesson plans appropriate for high school classes centered on our modular platform. The lesson plans should be compliant with the NGSS and statewide assessments.</li>
				<li>Planning a quantitative method to assess students’ learning and engagement in classroom post-fellowship program.</li>
			</ul>
				<p>At the end of summer research period, the teacher will be also working with the STEM Hub, for the course of 2 weeks, to provide workshops for teachers in middle Tennessee.</p>
