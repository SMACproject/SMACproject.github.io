		<h3>#1: Modular Capsule Robot STEM Educational Toolkit</h3>
		<h4>Primary Investigator:</h4>
		<p>Pietro Valdastri</p>
		
		<h4>Brief Description of Project:</h4>
		<p>At the <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/stormlab/">STORM Lab</a>, we are developing a miniature capsule robot toolkit for middle and high school classroom teaching. You can think about it as a small, modular, and super-easy-to-use version of Arduino. This research is supported by the National Science Foundation via the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/i-corps">I-Corps Program</a>, a program to foster commercialization of NSF-funded research.</p>

		<p>The project details can be found in here: <a href="http://www.cttc.co/cttc/content/vanderbilt-team-builds-miniature-capsule-robots-selected-nsf-i-corps">http://www.cttc.co/cttc/content/vanderbilt-team-builds-miniature-capsule-robots-selected-nsf-i-corps</a> 

		<p>During the summer period, we plan to add a Bluetooth module to the toolkit, so that we can control the robots from a tablet or a smartphone. We also plan to improve the programming interface and make it so simple that a middle school student can play with it.</p>

		<p>This opportunity comes with an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) fellowship.</p>

		<h4>Desired Qualifications:</h4>
		<p>Basic digital and electronic circuit, basic programming in C and/or Javascript, basic knowledge of developing simple app on mobile phone.</p>

		<h4>Nature of Supervision:</h4>
		<p>Over the course of the program, undergraduate students will be supervised by Dr. Susilo and by Dr. Valdastri.</p>

		<h4>A Brief Research Plan (period is for 10 weeks):</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Week 1: Introduction to the robotic toolkit developed in the STORM Lab</li>
			<li>Weeks 2-3: Getting started with existing firmware and software modules</li>
			<li>Weeks 4-8: Working on a simple remote control on mobile phone to control a robot</li>
			<li>Weeks 9-10: Project summary, publication of data, and final oral presentation to STORM Lab members</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Number of Slots: 2</h4>

		<h3>#2: Summer Fellowship for Teachers</h3>

		<p>An open fellowship for teachers for the course of 8-10 weeks of summer lab research at STORM Lab, Vanderbilt University, is available with the following tasks teacher:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Learn how the existing capsule robots are built in the laboratory out of miniature modules.</li>
			<li>Experimenting and improving our small modular platform to better fit within the Next Generation Science Standard (NGSS).</li>
			<li>Writing lesson plans appropriate for high school classes centered on our modular platform. The lesson plans should be compliant with the NGSS and statewide assessments.</li>
			<li>Planning a quantitative method to assess studentsâ€™ learning and engagement in classroom post-fellowship program.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>At the end of summer research period, the teacher will be also working with the STEM Hub, for the course of 2 weeks, to provide workshops for teachers in middle Tennessee. Interested to join the program? Please contact: (email and phone)</p>
